# Current state (last updated: 2026-09-20)

## Phase

Sweep in progress: 2026-09-20. Discovery found 82 candidates (default:
book000/tomacheese/jaoafa orgs, assignee=book000) — none matched an
existing ledger row (all classified NEW). Filling initial 5 concurrency
slots; refill loop in progress.

## Targets and their state

(populated per-PR as Investigators/Arbiters/Executors report in)

### book000/pixivts#1928

- checkpoint: fix-pr-opened
- dependency currency: `@book000/eslint-config` proposed 1.16.67, latest 1.16.67 — current, no special handling.
- detail: Same root-cause pattern as `tomacheese/fauxcord#314`/`tomacheese/telcheck#2635`. The eslint-config bump newly flags 42 pre-existing lint violations (41 errors, 1 warning) across `packages/core/src/*.ts`, `packages/core/tests/**`, `packages/db-mysql/tests/*.ts`, and `scripts/check-pr-language.mjs` (`unicorn/prefer-ternary`, `unicorn/prefer-early-return`, one unused eslint-disable directive). `pnpm run lint` (eslint step) fails, failing both `node-ci` and its downstream `Check finished Node CI`. Base branch is `develop` (not `main`). Fix: included the eslint-config 1.16.67 bump, ran `eslint . --fix` (38/41 auto-fixed) and hand-converted the remaining 3 `unicorn/prefer-early-return` cases (`novels.e2e.test.ts`, `illusts.test.ts`, `recorder.test.ts`). No push access to `book000/pixivts` — forked to `akubiusa/pixivts`, pushed there. Verified locally: `pnpm run lint` clean, `pnpm run test` 234/234 passing. Fix PR: https://github.com/book000/pixivts/pull/1931 — CI's `node-ci` job has been stuck in GitHub's `waiting` status (not `pending`/running) since ~11:03 UTC: the repo's workflow requires manual Environment approval (`fork-pr-build`) for any PR whose head repo differs from `book000/pixivts`, which is exactly the case here since I had no push access and opened from a fork. Only a `book000/pixivts` maintainer can click Approve on the Actions run; this is a normal, expected gate for external/fork PRs, not a code defect. Still `fix-pr-opened`, not `completed` — CI hasn't actually executed the lint fix yet.

### tomacheese/get-twitter-birthdays#332

- checkpoint: fix-pr-opened
- dependency currency: `@book000/eslint-config` proposed 1.16.67, latest 1.16.67 — current, no special handling.
- detail: Same root-cause pattern as `tomacheese/pex-crawler#2155`/`book000/pixivts#1928` (not the pnpm-v12 workspace-settings issue seen in `tomacheese/watch-vrchat-user#308` — different failure mode entirely). The eslint-config 1.16.67 bump newly flags 8 pre-existing lint violations (unicorn/prefer-early-return, unicorn/prefer-ternary x4, unicorn/prefer-smaller-scope, unicorn/no-immediate-mutation) across `src/core/calendar-sync.ts`, `src/core/following.ts`, `src/core/output.ts`, `src/infra/cycletls.ts`, `src/infra/storage.ts`. `pnpm run lint` (eslint step) fails, failing both `Node CI / node-ci (.)` and downstream `Node CI / Check finished Node CI`.

### tomacheese/watch-quicpay#2525

- checkpoint: fix-pr-opened
- dependency currency: `@book000/eslint-config` proposed 1.16.67, latest 1.16.67 — current, no special handling.
- detail: Different root cause than the earlier `tomacheese/watch-quicpay#2492` (pnpm-v12 workspace-settings issue). The eslint-config 1.16.67 bump pulls in `eslint-plugin-unicorn` 74.0.0 -> 75.0.0, which newly flags a pre-existing `unicorn/prefer-early-return` violation in `src/discord.ts` (the `if (token && channel_id) { ...rest of function... }` block). `pnpm run lint` fails, failing `Node CI / node-ci (.)` and its downstream `Check finished Node CI`. Fix: converted to an early return, included the eslint-config 1.16.67 bump. Had push access — pushed branch directly, no fork needed. Verified locally: `pnpm run lint` clean, `pnpm run test` 1/1 passing. Fix PR: https://github.com/tomacheese/watch-quicpay/pull/2531

### book000/fixdevcontainer#361

- checkpoint: completed
- dependency currency: `jest` proposed 30.5.1, latest 30.5.2 — stale-unexplained-minor, bumped to 30.5.2 in fix PR.
- detail: Same root-cause pattern as `tomacheese/pex-crawler#2155`/`book000/node-utils#1646`/`tomacheese/watch-discord-dev-changes#2335`/`jaoafa/jaotan.ts#2268`. Renovate bumps `jest` 30.4.2 -> 30.5.1, pulling in a brand-new transitive dependency, `@parcel/watcher@2.6.0`, which ships a native build/postinstall script. `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `allowBuilds` allow-list (currently only `unrs-resolver`) doesn't include it, so `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` hard-fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS: Ignored build scripts: @parcel/watcher@2.6.0`, failing `Node CI / node-ci (.)` and its downstream `Check finished Node CI`. Fix: added `'@parcel/watcher': true` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` allowBuilds, bumped `jest` to latest 30.5.2, regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`. No push access to `book000/fixdevcontainer` — forked to `akubiusa/fixdevcontainer`, pushed there. Verified locally: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` succeeds (no ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS), `pnpm test` 6/6 passing. Fix PR: https://github.com/book000/fixdevcontainer/pull/375 — CI confirmed green: both originally-failing checks passed (`Node CI / node-ci (.)`, `Node CI / Check finished Node CI`); no unrelated new failures (all 4 non-skipped checks passed).

done this sweep: 63 (fixed=63 skipped=0 blocked=0)

## Conflict-fixer queue

(empty — no fix PRs opened yet this sweep.)

## Escalate-to-user policy

No standing override in effect. Default behavior applies: relay any
`escalate-to-user` Arbiter verdict immediately via `AskUserQuestion`.

## Remaining broken Renovate PRs

(carried from prior sweeps, unaffected by this sweep unless re-discovered)

- book000/create-ts#65 — skipped: upstream rolldown-plugin-dts @volar/typescript type leak persists; owner previously declined special Renovate rule. Re-confirmed unchanged for 4 consecutive sweeps (2026-08-01, 2026-08-12, 2026-08-24, 2026-08-27).
- tomacheese/comico-downloader#831, tomacheese/api.tomacheese.com#511, tomacheese/collect-points#757, tomacheese/collect-points#697 — blocked: account-wide `tomacheese` org GitHub Actions billing/spending-limit outage, ongoing since 2026-08-22. No code fix possible; status not re-verified this sweep (not re-discovered by today's TSV — recheck next sweep if it recurs).

## Cleanup

`scratchpad/renovate-fix-chrome-response-recorder-409` still root-owned/unremovable (unchanged, 2026-09-20 re-check).

Duplicate fix PRs for the same root cause: `tomacheese/fetch-youtube-bgm#3021`'s fix PR #3031 and `#3023`'s fix PR #3033 both independently fix the identical `buildpack-deps:bullseye`→`bookworm` Dockerfile issue (discovered post-hoc by #3023's investigator; same-repo serialization was not violated, both were separate branches off master). Both are tracked by the fix-PR conflict/terminal monitor via the ledger; once one merges, close the other manually to avoid a stale/conflicting duplicate.

Triple-duplicate fix PRs: `tomacheese/watch-vrchat-user` sibling Renovate PRs #529/#530/#531 each independently produced a fix PR (#538/#539/#540) for the same pre-existing master-level `pnpm-lock.yaml` drift (stale `vrchat@2.22.8` patch + missing `allowBuilds` entry for `@parcel/watcher`), none merged yet as of #531's completion. Once any one of #538/#539/#540 merges, the other two become redundant/conflicting and should be closed manually. Watch for more `watch-vrchat-user` siblings (#532, #534-537 still queued) potentially adding further duplicates to this set.

## Next concrete action

Drive the 2026-09-20 sweep's refill loop to completion (82 candidates
queued, 5 in flight). Recommend the user resolve the `tomacheese` org's
GitHub Actions billing issue directly if it recurs in this sweep's
discovery.
